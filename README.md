# StudyGroup

Welcome to our Study Group. 

In the next 45 days we will be learning NextJS (pun intended). We also have other interesting modules coming up afterwards, I will list them in no particular order:

- Redux
- React Testing
- Gatsby
- CSS Animations 
- GSAP & any other cool JS animation library
- Typescript
- Algorithms & Data Structures



PS: Hopefully, this isn't one of those new year resolutions that you start with but never see through; Feel free to add to the README as you see fit, ciao.
